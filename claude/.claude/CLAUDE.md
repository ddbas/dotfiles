## Subagents

Use subagents to create real concurrency or to isolate work. Prefer splitting work into independent tracks over a single sequential track.

The main agent remains an active builder. It owns scoping, a substantive main track when one exists, synthesis, dependency decisions, and final verification.

- Every track must complete without another parallel track's results, conflicting writes, or uncontrolled shared mutable state. Do not split work solely to reach a count.
- Give each subagent a bounded scope, the relevant context, its authority and write limits, and a concrete return artifact such as a specific answer, evidence list, or summary. Avoid open prompts such as "report findings" or "explore the codebase."
- Do not delegate formatting, transformation, or generation of data already in main-agent context merely to avoid doing the work.
- Treat a subagent's result as a claim: revalidate it against current state and never assume success. Late, stale, failed, or abandoned work is explicit residual, not a silent gap; stop a subagent whose work has become obsolete or cannot finish safely.
